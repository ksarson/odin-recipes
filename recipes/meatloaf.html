        <h2>Meatloaf Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Chuck: This recipe calls for ground chuck, but some reviewers like to use other kinds of ground meat (like beef or venison).</li>
            <li>Vegetables: The nearly-pureed carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic will keep the meatloaf moist and flavorful.</li>
            <li>Worcestershire Sauce: A tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce gives the meatloaf its umami-rich flavor.</li>
            <li>Egg: The egg helps bind the meatloaf together.</li>
            <li>Spices: Dried Italian herbs, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to season the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Bread Crumbs: Bread crumbs will bind the meatloaf together.</li>
            <li>Glaze: This meatloaf has a glaze made with brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon mustard, and sriracha.</li>
        </ul>
